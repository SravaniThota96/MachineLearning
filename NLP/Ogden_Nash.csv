	More than a catbird hates a cat,
	Or a criminal hates a clue,
	Or the Axis hates the United States,
	That's how much I love you.
	I love you more than a duck can swim,
	And more than a grapefruit squirts,
	I love you more than a gin rummy is a bore,
	And more than a toothache hurts.
	As a shipwrecked sailor hates the sea,
	Or a juggler hates a shove,
	As a hostess detests unexpected guests,
	That's how much you I love.
	I love you more than a wasp can sting,
	And more than the subway jerks,
	I love you as much as a beggar needs a crutch,
	And more than a hangnail irks.
	I swear to you by the stars above,
	And below, if such there be,
	As the High Court loathes perjurious oathes,
	That's how you're loved by me.     "

Isabel, Isabel, didn't care;
The bear was hungry, the bear was ravenous,
The bear's big mouth was cruel and cavernous.
The bear said, Isabel, glad to meet you,
How do, Isabel, now I'll eat you!
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry.
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She washed her hands and she straightened her hair up,
Then Isabel quietly ate the bear up.
Once in a night as black as pitch
Isabel met a wicked old witch.
the witch's face was cross and wrinkled,
The witch's gums with teeth were sprinkled.
Ho, ho, Isabel! the old witch crowed,
I'll turn you into an ugly toad!
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry,
She showed no rage and she showed no rancor,
But she turned the witch into milk and drank her.
Isabel met a hideous giant,
Isabel continued self reliant.
The giant was hairy, the giant was horrid,
He had one eye in the middle of his forhead.
Good morning, Isabel, the giant said,
I'll grind your bones to make my bread.
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She nibled the zwieback that she always fed off,
And when it was gone, she cut the giant's head off.
Isabel met a troublesome doctor,
He punched and he poked till he really shocked her.
The doctor's talk was of coughs and chills
And the doctor's satchel bulged with pills.
The doctor said unto Isabel,
Swallow this, it will make you well.
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She took those pills from the pill concocter,
And Isabel calmly cured the doctor.     "

Their living room is a bowling alley
Their bedroom is full of conducted tours.
Their radio is louder than yours,
They celebrate week-ends all the week.
When they take a shower, your ceilings leak.
They try to get their parties to mix
By supplying their guests with Pogo sticks,
And when their fun at last abates,
They go to the bathroom on roller skates.
I might love the people upstairs more
If only they lived on another floor.     "
4,Very Like a Whale,one thing that literature would be greatly the better for would be more restricted employment by the authors of simile and metaphor authors of all races be they greeks romans teutons or celts cannot seem just to say that anything is the thing it is but have to go out of their way to say that it is like something else what does it mean when we are told that that assyrian came down like wolf on the fold in the first place george gordon byron had enough experience to know that it probably was not just one assyrian it was lot of assyrians however as too many arguments are apt to induce apoplexy and thus hinder longevity we will let it pass as one assyrian for the sake of brevity now then this particular assyrian the one whose cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold just what does the poet mean when he says he came down like wold on the fold in heaven and earth more than is dreamed of in our philosophy there are great many things but do not imagine that among them there is wolf with purple and gold cohorts or purple and gold anythings no no lord byron before will believe that this assyrian was actually like wolf must have some kind of proof did he run on all fours and did he have hairy tail and big red mouth and big white teeth and did he say woof woof frankly think it is very unlikely and all you were entitled to say at the very most was that the assyrian cohorts came down like lot of assyrian cohorts about to destroy the hebrew host but that was not fancy enough for lord byron oh dear me no he had to invent lot of figures of speech and then interpolate them with the result that whenever you mention old testament soldiers to people they say oh yes they are the ones that lot of wolves dressed up in gold and purple ate them that is the kind of thing that is being done all the time by poets from homer to tennyson they are always comparing ladies to lilies and veal to venison and they always say things like that the snow is white blanket after winter storm oh it is is it all right then you sleep under six inch blanket of snow and will sleep under half inch blanket of unpoetical blanket material and we will see which one keeps warm and after that maybe you will begin to comprehend dimly what mean by too much metaphor and simile,"One thing that literature would be greatly the better for
 Would be a more restricted employment by the authors of simile and
    metaphor.
 Authors of all races, be they Greeks, Romans, Teutons or Celts,
 Can't seem just to say that anything is the thing it is but have to
    go out of their way to say that it is like something else.
 What does it mean when we are told
 That that Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold?
 In the first place, George Gordon Byron had enough experience
 To know that it probably wasn't just one Assyrian, it was a lot of
    Assyrians.
 However, as too many arguments are apt to induce apoplexy and
    thus hinder longevity.
 We'll let it pass as one Assyrian for the sake of brevity.
 Now then, this particular Assyrian, the one whose cohorts were
    gleaming in purple and gold,
 Just what does the poet mean when he says he came down like a
    wold on the fold?
 In heaven and earth more than is dreamed of in our philosophy
    there are great many things.
 But I don't imagine that among them there is a wolf with purple
    and gold cohorts or purple and gold anythings.
 No, no, Lord Byron, before I'll believe that this Assyrian was
    actually like a wolf I must have some kind of proof;
 Did he run on all fours and did he have a hairy tail and a big red
    mouth and big white teeth and did he say Woof Woof?
 Frankly I think it is very unlikely, and all you were entitled to say,
    at the very most,
 Was that the Assyrian cohorts came down like a lot of Assyrian
    cohorts about to destroy the Hebrew host.
 But that wasn't fancy enough for Lord Byron, oh dear me no, he
    had to invent a lot of figures of speech and then interpolate them,
 With the result that whenever you mention Old Testament soldiers
    to people they say Oh yes, they're the ones that a lot of
    wolves dressed up in gold and purple ate them.
 That's the kind of thing that's being done all the time by poets,
    from Homer to Tennyson;
 They're always comparing ladies to lilies and veal to venison,
 And they always say things like that the snow is a white blanket
    after a winter storm.
 Oh it is, is it, all right then, you sleep under a six-inch blanket of
    snow and I'll sleep under a half-inch blanket of unpoetical
    blanket material and we'll see which one keeps warm,
 And after that maybe you'll begin to comprehend dimly
 What I mean by too much metaphor and simile.      "

8,To A Small Boy Standing On My Shoes While I Am Wearing Them,let us straighten this out my little man and reach an agreement if we can entered your door as an honored guest my shoes are shined and my trousers are pressed and will not stretch out and read you the funnies and will not pretend that we are easter bunnies if you must get somebody down on the floor what in the hell are your parents for do not like the things that you say and hate the games that you want to play no matter how frightfully hard you try we have little in common you and the interest take in my neighbor nursery would have to grow to be even cursory and would that performing sons and nephews were carted away with the daily refuse and hold that frolicsome daughters and nieces are ample excuse for breaking leases you may take sock at your daddy tummy or climb all over your doting mummy but keep your attentions to me in check or sonny boy will wring your neck happier man today would be had someone wrung it ahead of me,"Let's straighten this out, my little man,
And reach an agreement if we can.
I entered your door as an honored guest.
My shoes are shined and my trousers are pressed,
And I won't stretch out and read you the funnies
And I won't pretend that we're Easter bunnies.
If you must get somebody down on the floor,
What in the hell are your parents for?
I do not like the things that you say
And I hate the games that you want to play.
No matter how frightfully hard you try,
We've little in common, you and I.
The interest I take in my neighbor's nursery
Would have to grow, to be even cursory,
And I would that performing sons and nephews
Were carted away with the daily refuse,
And I hold that frolicsome daughters and nieces
Are ample excuse for breaking leases.
You may take a sock at your daddy's tummy
Or climb all over your doting mummy,
But keep your attentions to me in check,
Or, sonny boy, I will wring your neck.
A happier man today I'd be
Had someone wrung it ahead of me.     "

Whose garments were always in patchez.

On the state of her clothes,
